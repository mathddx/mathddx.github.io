# The man from the earth
Well, when John said that he was just trying to spread the teachings from Buddha, it was clear that eastern religions like Buddhism, Hinduism an Taoism spread mostly positive teachings for their devotes, in opposition to the recent history of the Bible based religions, the messianic ones, those of which get involved in **a lot** of conflicts and wars.

The idea of a "cave-man" being alive in the recent history is kind of the idea of [[The book]], which i do not have a name yet, but the book does not focus in a individual of a different species, instead, it focus on a big population of this different species and their living among *Homo sapiens sapiens*

# Books and AI
Perhaps i should stop looking after book recommendations, because there are already a bunch of unread books in the shelf (still true in June, 2025).
Vocabulary, journaling is helping with that, and the correct writing of some words that might help in the future.

The cover of I, robot that i did, it might not be ethical, AI was used in it, it kind of fits the theme of the book, but it has so  many more implications, the stolen art from various artists, glued all together to create that amalgamation of art-styles. At the same time, i would not demand time from an actual artist for a silly drawing and i could not draw what i had imagined, so AI seemed like the best alternative.
